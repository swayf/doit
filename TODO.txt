- remove tests dependency on unix cmds - (for windows)
- python 2.4
  . python 2.4 doesnt have hashlib. there is a package for backward compatibility on pypi. add hashlib as dependency.
- python 2.6
- easier group tasks (see email with prajwala)
- better error message when invalid task dependence
- directory dependency (lp)
. clarify -v "capture" (lp)
. improve result "output" (lp)
. no dependency but execute once if not cleared
. use sphinx

0.3
---

. continue execution even if one task fails
. dont show traceback for user errors

---

. one .doit for each dodo file
. default task
. support for depedency scanner
. multiple (include) dodo files
. color output on the terminal. 


Ideas
------

. it would be better if DoitTaks print the output not BaseTask, because BaseTask doesnt know about task dependencies. another problem is the order in which the task are sent to stdout... 

. now there are groupTask and subtask... need to think about it. maybe unify them.
