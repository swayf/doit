0.5
------------

- continue execution even if tasks fails (#441081)
. passing arguments on cmd line (#370914)
. dont calculate hash of all files everytime. use timestamp/size/hash (see mercurial dirstate) (#370920)
. dependency-checking functions (#438174)


0.X
----------

. tests for cmdline (#441084)

. dont get subtasks if task is not going to be executed (#370923)
. task process isolation. (execute tasks in a different process)
. option to make sub-task not part of a group


whishlist
----------

. list command improvements
. dont save successful results
. forget a dependency, not a task
. opposite of forget. mark as up-to-date.
. color output on the terminal. (#263576)
. use templates for output (see mercurial)

needs volunteer
----------------

. windows (#218276)


not clear how to implement
---------------------------

. support for depedency scanner (#218303)
. defer task generator - generator needs to run after a certain task
. one .doit for each dodo file
. multiple (include) dodo files (#218279)
. sub-command/task unification. all sub-commands (but run) implemented as tasks


Ideas
------

. it would be better if DoitTaks print the output not BaseTask, because ~~BaseTask doesnt know about task dependencies~~. another problem is the order in which the task are sent to stdout...
