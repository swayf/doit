0.4
---------------

. action as list of commands/python
. tools -> create folder
. tools -> forget task
. deprecate folder-depenency
. deprecate "action" use "actions"
. test for cmdline
. sub-cmd clean targets


0.5
------------

. passing arguments on cmd line (#370914)
. dont calculate hash of all files everytime. use timestamp/size/hash (see mercurial dirstate) (#370920)
. dont get subtasks if task is not going to be executed (#370923)
. task process isolation. (execute tasks in a different process)

----------

. defer task generator
. support for depedency scanner (lp - 218303)

. continue execution even if one task fails
. dont show traceback for user errors
. one .doit for each dodo file
. multiple (include) dodo files (lp - 218279)
. color output on the terminal. (lp - 263576)
. use templates for output (see mercurial)
. windows (lp - 218276)


Ideas
------

. it would be better if DoitTaks print the output not BaseTask, because ~~BaseTask doesnt know about task dependencies~~. another problem is the order in which the task are sent to stdout...
