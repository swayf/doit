doit - automation tool
======================

`doit` comes from the idea of bringing the power of build-tools to execute any kind of task. It will keep track of dependencies between "tasks" and execute them only when necessary. It was designed to be easy to use and "get out of your way".

In `doit`, unlike most (all?) build-tools, a task doesn't need to define a target file to use the execute only if not up-to-date feature. This make `doit` specially suitable for running test suites.

`doit` like most build tools is used to execute tasks defined in a configuration file. Configuration files are python modules. The tasks can be python functions or an external shell script/command. `doit` automatically keeps track of declared dependencies executing only tasks that needs to be update (based on which dependencies have changed).
